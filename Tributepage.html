        Bal Gangadhar Tilak  born Keshav Gangadhar Tilak 23 July 1856 – 1 August 1920, endeared as Lokmanya , 
        was an Indian nationalist, teacher, and an independence activist. .He was one third of the Lal Bal Pal
         triumvirate. Tilak was the first leader of the Indian independence movement. The .itish colonial 
         authorities called him "The father of the Indian unrest". He was also conferred with the title of 
         "Lokmanya", which means "accepted by the people as their leader". Mahatma Gandhi called him "The Maker 
         of Modern India".

        Tilak was one of the first and strongest advocates of Swaraj ('self-rule') and a strong radical in Indian consciousness.
         He is known for his quote in Marathi: "Swaraj is my birthright and I shall have it!".
          He formed a close alliance with many Indian National Congress leaders including Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala 
          Lajpat Rai, Aurobindo Ghose, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai
           and Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
